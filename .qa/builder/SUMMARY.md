## PR Gate Expectations

Per PR_GATE_DEBUG_REPORTS_POLICY.md Section 3, PR gates will verify:
1. Gate debug reports exist and are schema-compliant
2. Governance artifacts are complete
3. Scope declaration is valid
4. No cascading failures present

**Note:** Gate debug reports are generated BY the gates themselves. Builder QA reports (this directory) represent the builder's pre-handover verification. Gates enforce that verification occurred.

## Handover Decision

**Status:** READY FOR MERGE

**Justification:**
- All builder QA checks PASS
- Governance compliance verified
- Policy integration complete
- No prohibited actions detected
- Scope frozen and validated

**Next Steps:**
1. Merge PR #683
2. Gates will execute and generate their own reports
3. Gate reports will validate builder QA was performed
4. Johan can inspect `.qa/builder/` for builder verification artifacts
5. Johan can inspect `.github/gate-reports/` for gate enforcement artifacts

## Authority

Builder QA performed per BUILDER AGENT DIRECTIVE from Johan Ras (comment 3681113223).
