# CHP Proposals Directory

## Purpose

This directory contains memory proposals generated by the Cognitive Hygiene Protocol (CHP) for governance review.

## What Are CHP Proposals?

CHP proposals are insights, patterns, or learnings that CHP observes during hygiene operations and submits for governance review. Proposals are **NOT** canonical memory until explicitly approved and written by the Governance Administrator.

## Key Principles

### Insight ≠ Memory
- **Insight**: A pattern or finding that CHP observes during hygiene operations
- **Proposal**: A documented insight submitted for governance review (this directory)
- **Memory**: Canonical, governance-approved knowledge (stored elsewhere after approval)

### Proposal Lifecycle
1. CHP generates proposal based on hygiene findings
2. CHP writes proposal to this directory
3. Governance Administrator or Foreman reviews proposal
4. Decision: Approve, Reject, Modify, Escalate to Human
5. If approved: Governance Administrator writes to canonical memory
6. If rejected: Proposal archived with rationale

### No Auto-Promotion
- ❌ Proposals do NOT automatically become memory
- ❌ Repeated proposals do NOT create implicit approval
- ❌ Emergency findings do NOT bypass governance review
- ❌ Escalations do NOT authorize memory writes

## Proposal File Format

Each proposal should be named: `CHP-PROP-{YYYY}-{NNN}.md` (e.g., `CHP-PROP-2025-001.md`)

### Required Content

Every proposal MUST include:

#### Metadata
- Proposal ID
- Proposal Date
- Proposing Agent (CHP)
- Category (Governance, Architecture, QA, Learning, Pattern)
- Priority (Routine, Important, Critical)

#### Content
- Learning Description
- Evidence
- Justification
- Impact
- Proposed Memory Location

#### Context
- Trigger
- Recurrence
- Scope
- Related Learnings

#### Recommendation
- Recommended Action
- Alternative Options
- Implementation Guidance

## Governance Review

### Review Authority
- **Governance Administrator**: Reviews governance, learning, and pattern proposals
- **Foreman**: Reviews QA and architectural proposals
- **Human (Johan)**: Reviews critical or ambiguous proposals

### Review Timeline
- **Routine**: 1 hour (target)
- **Important**: 4 hours
- **Critical**: 1 hour + escalate to Human if needed

### Decision Record
Each proposal should have a corresponding decision file: `CHP-PROP-{YYYY}-{NNN}-decision.md`

Decision file MUST include:
- Decision outcome (Approve, Reject, Modify, Escalate)
- Decision authority (who decided)
- Decision rationale
- Action authorized (if approved)
- Decision timestamp

## Integration

This proposal workflow implements:
- `governance/canon/COGNITIVE_HYGIENE_MEMORY_INTEGRATION_MODEL.md` (Section 6)
- `maturion/cognitive-hygiene-protocol-spec.md` (Section 4)
- `governance/memory/AUTHORITY/MEMORY_WRITE_POLICY.md`

## Audit Trail

All proposals and decisions are logged in:
- `memory/AUDIT/memory-write-log.md` (canonical memory writes)
- This directory (proposal submission and decision records)

---

**Note**: This directory is for proposals only. Approved learnings are written to canonical memory locations as determined by the Governance Administrator.
