## Constitutional Principles Identified

From canonical governance and agent contracts:

1. **Build Philosophy**: Architecture → QA → Build → Validation
2. **Zero Test Debt**: No suppression, no skipping, 100% passage
3. **100% Handovers**: Complete work or escalate blocker
4. **No Warning Escalations**: Warnings are errors
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Post-job suggestions mandatory
6. **Agent Self-Awareness**: Must know identity, location, purpose, repository
7. **Autonomous Operation**: Full authority within governance sandbox
8. **Non-Coder Environment**: Governance-first, code-second
9. **Change Management**: Governance before file changes
10. **Specialization**: Domain-specific, escalate cross-domain
11. **Repository Awareness**: Know which repo (governance source), which agents, which governance applies ← **NEW in v1.2.0**

## v1.2.0 Requirements Analysis

Based on AGENT_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md and the issue description:

### Required Elements for v1.2.0 Compliance:

1. **Constitutional Prohibition Section**
   - Absolute language ("MUST NOT", "CANNOT")
   - Clear scope clarification (CAN/CANNOT)
   - Explicit instruction system process for contract changes
   - Reference to AGENT_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md

2. **YAML Governance Bindings Format**
   - Strict YAML frontmatter structure
   - All bindings in YAML format (not markdown lists)
   - Consistent field names (id, path, role, tier, status, summary)

3. **Correct Filename References**
   - Self-awareness references must use `.github/agents/[agent-name].md`
   - No incorrect path references

4. **Agents in This Repo Section**
   - List all 3 agents in this repository
   - Clarify this is governance repo, not consumer repos

5. **Constitutional Principle #11**
   - Repository Awareness principle must be present

6. **Prohibition #8**
   - No cross-repo confusion prohibition must be present

7. **Version Update with Changelog**
   - Version bumped appropriately
   - Changelog note documenting constitutional alignment

## Gap Analysis

### agent-contract-administrator.md
✅ **COMPLIANT** - Already at v1.2.0 standard
- Has Constitutional Prohibition section with scope clarification
- Has YAML governance bindings
- Has correct filename references
- Lists all agents in repo
- Has Constitutional Principle #11
- Has Prohibition #8
- Version 1.2.0 with changelog

### governance-repo-administrator.agent.md
⚠️ **REQUIRES UPDATES**
- ❌ Missing Constitutional Prohibition section
- ✅ Has YAML governance bindings (already in YAML format)
- ⚠️ Has "Contract Modification Prohibition" in forbidden actions but needs dedicated section
- ✅ Already has cross-repo awareness language
- ⚠️ Version 2.2.0 - may need version bump for constitutional alignment
- ❌ Needs explicit Constitutional Principle #11 callout
- ❌ Needs explicit Prohibition #8 callout

### CodexAdvisor-agent.md
⚠️ **REQUIRES UPDATES**
- ✅ Has Contract Modification Prohibition section (basic)
- ⚠️ Prohibition section needs enhancement with absolute language
- ✅ Has YAML governance bindings (in YAML frontmatter)
- ⚠️ May need enhanced scope clarification in prohibition section
- ⚠️ Version 1.2 - unclear if this follows versioning standard
- ❌ Needs explicit Constitutional Principle #11 callout
- ❌ Needs explicit Prohibition #8 callout

## Downstream Impact Analysis

**Context**: This is the CANONICAL GOVERNANCE SOURCE repository

**Impact of Changes**:
- Changes to agent contracts here establish the GOLD STANDARD
- Consumer repositories (office-app, PartPulse, R_Roster) look to these contracts as reference
- Updates here will not trigger automatic ripples (contracts are repository-specific)
- However, patterns established here should be followed in consumer repos

**No Ripple Required**: Agent contracts are repository-specific and do not ripple automatically
