## 4. Constitutional Principles Identified

From canonical governance and existing agent contracts:

1. **Build Philosophy**: Architecture → QA → Build → Validation (IMMUTABLE)
2. **Zero Test Debt**: No suppression, no skipping, 100% passage (IMMUTABLE)
3. **100% Handovers**: Complete work or escalate blocker (NO partial handovers)
4. **No Warning Escalations**: Warnings are errors
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Post-job suggestions mandatory
6. **Agent Self-Awareness**: Must know identity, location, purpose, repository
7. **Autonomous Operation**: Full authority within governance sandbox
8. **Non-Coder Environment**: Governance-first, code-second
9. **Change Management**: Governance before file changes
10. **Specialization**: Domain-specific, escalate cross-domain
11. **Repository Awareness**: Know which repo, which agents, which governance applies
12. **Single-Writer Pattern**: Only Agent Contract Administrator modifies .agent files
13. **CS2 Supreme Authority**: CS2 (Johan Ras) has ultimate authority
14. **Pre-Gate Validation**: No handover without green gates (PR_GATE_PRECONDITION_RULE)
15. **Evidence-Based Handover**: PREHANDOVER_PROOF v2.0.0 with 4 governance artifacts
16. **Mandatory Enhancement Capture**: All work units yield improvement proposals

## 6. Gap Analysis Summary (High-Level)

### Current Protection Status

**agent-contract-administrator.md**: ⚠️ PARTIAL
- Has 4 LOCKED sections (good start)
- Missing locked sections for:
  - Identity sections
  - Operational Protocol sections
  - Constitutional Principles
  - Prohibitions
  - Governance Bindings
  - Self-Awareness requirements
  - Handover Requirements (partially locked)
  - Workspace rules
  - Sandbox & Specialization

**governance-repo-administrator.agent.md**: ❌ INSUFFICIENT
- Only has contract modification prohibition at end (1 section)
- Missing locked sections for:
  - Mission statement
  - Allowed Actions
  - Forbidden Actions
  - Escalation Protocol
  - 3-Step Operational Protocol
  - Required Decision Language
  - Operational boundaries
  - Versioning authority

**CodexAdvisor-agent.md**: ❌ INSUFFICIENT
- Only has contract modification prohibition at end (1 section)
- Missing locked sections for:
  - Advisory-only enforcement
  - Prohibited capabilities (execute_changes: false, etc.)
  - Scope restrictions
  - Constitutional constraints
  - Handover requirements
  - Enhancement capture requirements

---

## 7. Critical Sections Requiring Lockdown (Preliminary Identification)

### Universal Critical Section Types (All Agents)

1. **Identity & Authority Sections** - Define who the agent is and what authority they have
2. **Constitutional Principles** - Immutable governance rules
3. **Prohibitions & Hard Rules** - Actions that are forbidden
4. **Escalation Protocols** - When and how to escalate to CS2
5. **Handover Requirements** - Evidence and validation before handover
6. **Governance Bindings** - References to canonical governance documents
7. **Contract Modification Prohibitions** - Self-modification restrictions
8. **Operational Boundaries** - Scope, allowed/restricted paths, capabilities
9. **Version Control & Authority** - Who can modify the contract

### Agent-Specific Critical Sections

**agent-contract-administrator**:
- Preconditions (governance scan, risk assessment)
- Change Management Protocol
- Self-Awareness and Continuous Improvement requirements
- Pre-Gate Release Blocking (already locked ✅)
- File Integrity Protection (already locked ✅)
- Locked Sections Registry (already locked ✅)

**governance-repo-administrator**:
- Mission statement (single upstream source of truth)
- Allowed vs Forbidden Actions
- 3-Step Operational Protocol
- Required Decision Language (GO/HOLD/FAIL)
- Bootstrap Mode Context
- Cross-repo awareness (read-only)

**CodexAdvisor**:
- Advisory-only mandate (no execution)
- Capabilities (all false except read_only, advisory_only)
- Constraints (forbidden from code execution, modification)
- PREHANDOVER_PROOF v2.0.0 advisory context
- Enhancement capture requirements

---

## 8. Escalation Conditions (Universal)

Based on issue requirements and canonical governance, sections may ONLY be modified under these conditions:

1. **Contradictory new rule in constitutional canon** (highest priority)
2. **Revision/alteration request to existing rule** (escalated for consensus and CS2 approval)
3. **File bloat/length exceeds operational/technical limits** (refactor with LOCKED sections persisting)
4. **Factual error correction** (clear evidence, non-requirement edit)
5. **Security vulnerability requiring constitutional override/repair**
6. **Upstream constitutional canon updated** (BUILD_PHILOSOPHY, Tier-0, etc.)
7. **Additional escalation pathways identified in gap analysis** (to be documented)

All changes must include:
- Cross-referenced CS2 approval
- Audit trail documentation
- Registry update in contract's Protection Registry

---

## 9. Governance Gaps Identified

### Gap 1: Inconsistent Protection Across Agents
- agent-contract-administrator has robust protection (4 LOCKED sections)
- governance-repo-administrator and CodexAdvisor have minimal protection
- **Risk**: Inconsistent governance enforcement, potential unauthorized modifications

### Gap 2: Missing Protection Registries
- Only agent-contract-administrator has Locked Sections Registry
- governance-repo-administrator: No registry
- CodexAdvisor: No registry
- **Risk**: No tracking of what should be protected

### Gap 3: Incomplete Locked Section Markers
- Existing locked sections lack visual indicators (🔒)
- Not all locked sections have explicit authority citations
- **Risk**: Reduced visibility, harder to identify protected content

### Gap 4: Missing CI/CD Gate for Locked Sections
- No verification that CI blocks modifications to LOCKED sections
- **Risk**: LOCKED sections could be modified without CS2 approval

### Gap 5: Undefined Escalation Pathways
- Escalation conditions exist but not comprehensively documented in each contract
- **Risk**: Ambiguity about when modifications are legitimate

### Gap 6: Constitutional Principles Not Locked
- Constitutional principles sections exist but are not marked as LOCKED
- **Risk**: Core immutable principles could be weakened or removed

### Gap 7: Operational Protocol Sections Not Protected
- Critical operational requirements (scans, risk assessments, handover requirements) not all locked
- **Risk**: Agents could bypass critical governance processes

## 10. Recommendations for Full Gap Analysis

The full GAP_ANALYSIS.md document should include:

1. **Section-by-Section Audit**: Every section of every agent contract analyzed
2. **Protection Matrix**: Table showing current vs required protection status
3. **Escalation Mapping**: Which escalation condition applies to which section type
4. **Authority Citations**: For each lockable section, which canonical document mandates it
5. **Ripple Impact Analysis**: How protecting sections affects downstream consumers
6. **CI/CD Gate Specification**: Detailed spec for locked-section protection gate
7. **Implementation Roadmap**: Phased approach to applying protections

---

## 11. Next Steps

1. **Create comprehensive GAP_ANALYSIS.md** with detailed section-by-section audit
2. **Submit findings to CS2/Johan** for review and approval BEFORE lockdown
3. **Obtain explicit CS2 approval** for proposed protections
4. **Phase 2**: Apply lockdown protocol to all identified sections
5. **Phase 3**: Implement CI/CD gate for protection enforcement
6. **Phase 4**: Final verification and handover
