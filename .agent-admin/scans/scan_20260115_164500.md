## Gate Infrastructure Scan

### Current Gate Workflows

#### ✅ Present
- `.github/workflows/governance-gate.yml` - Governance structure validation
- `.github/workflows/governance-scope-to-diff-gate.yml` - Scope-to-diff enforcement
- `.github/workflows/locked-section-protection-gate.yml` - Locked section protection
- `.github/workflows/fm-effectiveness-validation-gate.yml` - FM effectiveness
- `.github/workflows/fm-failure-enforcement-gate.yml` - FM failure enforcement
- `.github/workflows/fm-failure-promotion-gate.yml` - FM failure promotion
- `.github/workflows/fm-learning-promotion-gate.yml` - FM learning promotion

#### ❌ Missing (from PR #971)
- `.github/workflows/pre-implementation-review.yml` - Governance-only exemptions
- `.github/workflows/yaml-validation.yml` - Yamllint with warning tolerance
- `.github/scripts/validate-scope-to-diff.sh` - Scope auto-generation script
- Updated `.github/scripts/check_locked_sections.py` - Hybrid protection model support

## PR #971 Analysis

**PR Status**: CLOSED (not merged)  
**PR Title**: BL-027/028 Gate Fixes  
**PR Author**: Unknown (requires investigation)  
**Closure Reason**: Unknown (requires investigation)

**Proposed Fixes** (inferred from issue #972):
1. **Scope auto-generation**: Generate SCOPE_DECLARATION.md when missing
2. **Governance-only exemption**: Skip pre-implementation review for governance-only PRs
3. **Hybrid protection support**: Support reference-based protection (v2.5.0)
4. **Yamllint tolerance**: Allow style warnings, block only on errors

**Implementation Status**: NOT MERGED - Fixes not in main branch

## Current vs. Expected Behavior

### Scope Declaration Gate
**Current**: Validates existing SCOPE_DECLARATION.md against diff  
**Expected (PR #971)**: Auto-generates when missing  
**Gap**: Auto-generation capability absent

### Pre-Implementation Review
**Current**: Workflow does not exist  
**Expected (PR #971)**: Workflow with governance-only exemptions  
**Gap**: Entire workflow missing

### Locked Section Protection
**Current**: Validates embedded LOCKED sections  
**Expected (PR #971)**: Supports hybrid model (embedded + reference-based)  
**Gap**: May fail on reference-based contracts

### YAML Validation
**Current**: Workflow does not exist  
**Expected (PR #971)**: Yamllint with warning tolerance  
**Gap**: Entire workflow missing

---

## Repository Context Scan

### Agent Contracts (`.github/agents/`)
- `CodexAdvisor-agent.md` - v2.5.0 (reference-based protection)
- `governance-repo-administrator.agent.md` - v2.5.0 (reference-based protection)
- `agent-contract-administrator.agent.md` - Exists (version unknown)

**Protection Model**: All upgraded contracts use reference-based protection (v2.5.0)

### Governance Structure
- `governance/canon/` - Canonical protocols present
- `governance/philosophy/` - Doctrine files present
- `governance/templates/` - Templates present
- `governance/escalation/` - Escalation policy present
- `governance/scope-declaration.md` - EXISTS (from previous PR #972)

## Governance Compliance Scan

### Constitutional Principles
- ✅ Build Philosophy: N/A (test task, no build)
- ✅ Zero Test Debt: N/A (test task, no tests)
- ⚠️ 100% Handovers: Pending completion
- ✅ No Warning Escalations: No warnings generated
- ⚠️ Continuous Improvement: Pending (end of task)
- ✅ Agent Self-Awareness: Contract v2.5.0 compliant
- ✅ Autonomous Operation: Operating autonomously
- ✅ Repository Awareness: Governance source repository

### Protection Protocol Compliance
- ✅ Contract Modification Prohibition: Not violated (no contract modifications)
- ✅ Pre-Gate Release Validation: N/A (test task)
- ✅ File Integrity Protection: Maintained
- ⚠️ Mandatory Enhancement Capture: Pending (end of task)

## Findings Summary

### Critical
1. **PR #971 NOT MERGED**: Gate fixes not in main branch
2. **Missing Workflows**: pre-implementation-review.yml, yaml-validation.yml
3. **Missing Scripts**: validate-scope-to-diff.sh

### High
1. **Gate Execution Issue**: All gates show `action_required` with 0 jobs
2. **Hybrid Protection Support**: Unknown if current gates support v2.5.0

### Medium
1. **Test Validation**: Cannot fully test PR #971 without it being merged

### Recommendations
1. **ESCALATE TO CS2**: Review and merge PR #971
2. **Investigate**: Why PR #971 was closed instead of merged
3. **Re-test**: After PR #971 merge, repeat this test
