**Lines Added**: ~134 lines

**Sections Added**:

1. **Overview Section**
   - Purpose statement
   - Authority reference (EXECUTION_BOOTSTRAP_PROTOCOL.md)
   - Artifact options (embed OR separate files)
   - Cross-reference format for `.agent-admin/` files

2. **Artifact 1: Governance Scan**
   - Scan ID, timestamp, agent, purpose
   - Repository context verification
   - Governance documents discovered
   - Gap analysis
   - Scan conclusion

3. **Artifact 2: Risk Assessment**
   - Risk assessment ID, date, agent, task
   - Risk categories with likelihood/impact matrix
   - Mitigation strategies per risk
   - Overall risk level
   - Recommendation (PROCEED/HOLD/HALT)

4. **Artifact 3: Change Record**

#### Section 3: Completion Checklist (ENHANCED)

**Lines Added**: ~10 lines (embedded within existing section)

**Items Added**:
- [ ] **Embedded Governance Artifacts** section complete (embedded OR cross-referenced)
  - [ ] Governance Scan documented with repository context and gap analysis
  - [ ] Risk Assessment documented with risk categories and mitigation strategies
  - [ ] Change Record documented with detailed changes and validation results
  - [ ] Completion Summary documented with requirements checklist and impact analysis
- [ ] **CST Validation Attestation** section complete
  - [ ] CST applicability determination completed with checklist
  - [ ] If CST required: validation attestation complete with all scenarios tested
  - [ ] If CST not required: justification documented with decision framework criteria

**Rationale**: Ensures new sections are included in pre-submission verification

---

#### Section 4: FAQ (ENHANCED)

**Lines Added**: ~40 lines

**New Questions Added**:

1. **Q: Should I embed governance artifacts in PREHANDOVER_PROOF or create separate files?**
   - Guidance: Either approach acceptable
   - Embedded: best for smaller work units
   - Separate files: best for complex work units
   - Recommendation: consistency within repository

2. **Q: What if my work unit doesn't require all 4 governance artifacts?**
   - Answer: All 4 required, but may be brief for simple changes
   - Brevity acceptable, absence not acceptable

3. **Q: How do I know if CST validation is required for my work unit?**
   - Answer: Use CST Decision Framework in template
   - CST required if: integration points, architectural boundaries
   - CST not required if: isolated work, governance-only
   - Consult COMBINED_TESTING_PATTERN.md or FM when uncertain

4. **Q: What if CST was identified in wave planning but I'm only doing a small subwave?**
   - Answer: CST may be deferred to convergence checkpoint
   - Document in "CST Not Required" section with checkpoint reference
   - CST is checkpoint-based, not every-PR-based

5. **Q: Can I use screenshots instead of text output?**
   - (Existing question - no changes)

**Rationale**: Addresses anticipated questions about new sections, reducing confusion

---

#### Section 5: Related Documents (ENHANCED)

**Lines Added**: ~3 lines

**Documents Added**:
- `governance/canon/COMBINED_TESTING_PATTERN.md` — CST and CWT validation requirements
- `governance/canon/AGENT_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md` — Agent contract authority and modification protocol

**Rationale**: Provides authority references for new sections

---

#### Section 6: Template Metadata (ENHANCED)

**Lines Changed**: ~8 lines

**Updates**:
- **Last Updated**: 2026-01-11 → 2026-01-13
- **Authority**: Added COMBINED_TESTING_PATTERN.md v1.0.0
- **Changelog**: Added
  - **2026-01-13**: Added Embedded Governance Artifacts section and CST Validation Attestation section per Subwave 3.3 learnings
  - **2026-01-11**: Initial template creation with core PREHANDOVER_PROOF sections

**Rationale**: Documents template evolution and authority references

- ✅ Flexibility options address adoption concerns
- ✅ Clear authority references support correct usage
