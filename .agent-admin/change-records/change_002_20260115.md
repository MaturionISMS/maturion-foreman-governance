## Change Context

### Task Objective
Verify that PR #971 gate fixes work correctly by:
1. Testing scope declaration auto-generation
2. Testing governance-only PR exemption
3. Testing hybrid protection model support
4. Testing yamllint warning tolerance

### Approach
1. Make minimal test change (add comment)
2. Do NOT update SCOPE_DECLARATION.md (test auto-generation)
3. Observe gate behavior
4. Document findings

### Findings
- PR #971 NOT MERGED: Gate fixes not in main branch
- Gates show `action_required` with 0 jobs executed
- Cannot fully test features that don't exist
- Recommendation: Escalate to CS2 for PR #971 review
