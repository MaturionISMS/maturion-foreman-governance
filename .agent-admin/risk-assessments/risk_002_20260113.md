# Risk Assessment: PREHANDOVER_PROOF Template Enhancement

**Risk Assessment ID**: risk_002_20260113  
**Date**: 2026-01-13  
**Agent**: governance-repo-administrator  
**Task**: Enhance PREHANDOVER_PROOF template with embedded governance artifacts and CST validation sections

---

## Repository Context

**Repository**: APGI-cmy/maturion-foreman-governance  
**Type**: CANONICAL GOVERNANCE SOURCE (highest authority)  
**Branch**: copilot/update-prehandover-proof-template  
**Work Type**: Template enhancement (governance documentation)

---

## Risk Categories

### 1. Template Adoption Risk

**Risk**: Enhanced template may be perceived as too complex or verbose, leading to reduced adoption

**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: MEDIUM  
**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Provide clear flexibility statement (embed OR separate files)
- ✅ Include concise FAQ entries addressing complexity concerns
- ✅ Maintain existing core structure (additions are optional guidance)
- ✅ Provide both embedded and cross-reference options
- ✅ Examples from actual usage (Wave 3.3 artifacts)

**Residual Risk**: MINIMAL - Flexibility options address concern

---

### 2. Template Clarity Risk

**Risk**: New sections may be unclear or ambiguous, leading to inconsistent usage

**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: MEDIUM  
**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Use clear, structured templates for each artifact
- ✅ Provide explicit checklists (CST applicability, acceptance criteria)
- ✅ Include authority references for each section
- ✅ Add FAQ entries addressing common questions
- ✅ Use consistent formatting and language from existing sections

**Residual Risk**: MINIMAL - Clear structure and examples provided

---

### 3. Authority Reference Risk

**Risk**: Authority references may be incorrect or outdated

**Likelihood**: VERY LOW  
**Impact**: MEDIUM  
**Mitigation**:
- ✅ All authority documents verified to exist during governance scan
- ✅ Version numbers included where applicable (COMBINED_TESTING_PATTERN v1.0.0)
- ✅ Multiple authority references cross-checked
- ✅ Tier-0 documents referenced correctly

**Residual Risk**: MINIMAL - All authorities verified

---

### 4. Downstream Ripple Risk

**Risk**: Template changes may create expectations or requirements for existing PRs

**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: LOW  
**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Template is guidance, not enforcement (PRs can use previous template version)
- ✅ Changes are additive (don't invalidate existing PREHANDOVER_PROOF artifacts)
- ✅ Flexibility statement allows for gradual adoption
- ✅ No retroactive compliance required

**Residual Risk**: ACCEPTABLE - Template evolution is expected

---

### 5. CST Applicability Confusion Risk

**Risk**: Users may misunderstand when CST is required vs. optional

**Likelihood**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: LOW  
**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Clear CST Decision Framework checklist provided
- ✅ Both "CST Required" and "CST Not Required" sections included
- ✅ FAQ entry addresses CST applicability determination
- ✅ Authority reference to COMBINED_TESTING_PATTERN.md Section 4.2
- ✅ Examples of when to skip CST included

**Residual Risk**: ACCEPTABLE - Guidance is clear, edge cases may require FM judgment

---

### 6. Artifact Duplication Risk

**Risk**: Users may create both embedded and separate artifacts, leading to duplication

**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: LOW  
**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Clear "choose ONE of the following approaches" language
- ✅ FAQ entry addresses embedded vs. separate decision
- ✅ Cross-reference format provided for separate files
- ⚠️ No technical enforcement (relies on user reading)

**Residual Risk**: ACCEPTABLE - Duplication is low impact (just extra artifacts)

---

### 7. Template Length Risk

**Risk**: Template length (813 lines from 551) may be perceived as too long

**Likelihood**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: LOW  
**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Length increase is primarily due to structured templates (not prose)
- ✅ Users only fill in sections relevant to their work
- ✅ Flexibility options reduce perceived burden
- ✅ Length reflects completeness for 10/10 governance compliance
- ⚠️ Consider creating "quick start" vs. "comprehensive" versions in future

**Residual Risk**: ACCEPTABLE - Completeness justifies length

---

### 8. Governance Conflicts Risk

**Risk**: New sections may conflict with existing governance canon

**Likelihood**: VERY LOW  
**Impact**: HIGH  
**Mitigation**:
- ✅ All authority documents reviewed during governance scan
- ✅ No conflicts identified with EXECUTION_BOOTSTRAP_PROTOCOL
- ✅ No conflicts identified with COMBINED_TESTING_PATTERN
- ✅ Changes align with recent governance evolution (Wave 3.3 learnings)
- ✅ Template is additive (strengthens, doesn't contradict)

**Residual Risk**: MINIMAL - No conflicts identified

---

## Risk Summary Matrix

| Risk Category | Likelihood | Impact | Residual Risk |
|--------------|------------|--------|---------------|
| Template Adoption | LOW | MEDIUM | MINIMAL |
| Template Clarity | LOW | MEDIUM | MINIMAL |
| Authority Reference | VERY LOW | MEDIUM | MINIMAL |
| Downstream Ripple | LOW | LOW | ACCEPTABLE |
| CST Applicability Confusion | MEDIUM | LOW | ACCEPTABLE |
| Artifact Duplication | LOW | LOW | ACCEPTABLE |
| Template Length | MEDIUM | LOW | ACCEPTABLE |
| Governance Conflicts | VERY LOW | HIGH | MINIMAL |

**Overall Risk Level**: **LOW**

---

## Change Impact Assessment

### Immediate Impact
- ✅ Template becomes more comprehensive (10/10 governance compliance)
- ✅ Users have clear guidance for governance artifacts
- ✅ CST validation process is documented
- ⚠️ Template length increases by ~47% (261 lines added)

### Downstream Impact
- ✅ Consumer repos (office-app, PartPulse, R_Roster) can adopt enhanced template
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing PREHANDOVER_PROOF usage
- ✅ Gradual adoption expected (not mandatory)
- ✅ Establishes pattern for future governance artifact documentation

### Risk Mitigation Effectiveness
- ✅ All HIGH and MEDIUM impact risks reduced to MINIMAL or ACCEPTABLE
- ✅ No CATASTROPHIC risks identified
- ✅ Flexibility options address most concerns
- ✅ Clear authority references support correct usage

---

## Recommendation

**PROCEED** with PREHANDOVER_PROOF template enhancement

**Rationale**:
1. All risks are LOW or MINIMAL overall
2. Changes align with governance canon and recent learnings
3. Flexibility options address adoption and complexity concerns
4. No governance conflicts identified
5. Template enhancement serves 10/10 governance compliance goal
6. Changes are additive and non-breaking

**Conditions**:
- ✅ Complete post-change validation (markdown syntax, section consistency)
- ✅ Document all changes in change record
- ✅ Create completion summary with evidence
- ✅ Review git diff to confirm surgical changes only

---

## Future Considerations

**Potential Future Enhancements** (PARKED - NOT AUTHORIZED):
1. Create "quick start" vs. "comprehensive" template versions
2. Add automated artifact cross-reference validator
3. Create template usage examples from real PRs
4. Consider interactive template generator tool
