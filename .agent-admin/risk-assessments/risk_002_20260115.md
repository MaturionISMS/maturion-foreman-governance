# Risk Assessment: Gate Fixes Verification Test
**Assessment ID**: risk_002_20260115  
**Date**: 2026-01-15T16:45:30Z  
**Agent**: governance-repo-administrator  
**Task**: Test: Verify Gate Fixes from PR #971 (BL-027/028)

---

## Executive Summary

**Risk Level**: LOW (test task, no production impact)  
**Impact**: Documentation and evidence gathering only  
**Likelihood**: N/A (test execution, not system change)

This risk assessment covers the test execution for verifying gate fixes from PR #971. The test itself poses minimal risk as it only adds a comment to a file and documents gate behavior.

---

## Risk Categories

### 1. Execution Risk
**Level**: LOW  
**Probability**: <5%  
**Impact**: Minimal

**Description**: Risk that test execution causes unintended side effects

**Factors**:
- ✅ Single line change (HTML comment)
- ✅ No functional code modified
- ✅ Governance-only change
- ✅ Easily reversible

**Mitigation**:
- Test change is non-invasive (comment only)
- Can be reverted with single commit
- No production systems affected

---

### 2. Gate Behavior Risk
**Level**: MEDIUM  
**Probability**: 100% (observed)  
**Impact**: Documentation

**Description**: Risk that gates behave unexpectedly without PR #971

**Observed Behavior**:
- All gates: `action_required` status, 0 jobs executed
- Scope-to-diff gate: Did not auto-generate scope declaration
- Pre-implementation review: Workflow does not exist
- Yamllint validation: Workflow does not exist

**Impact**:
- Cannot merge PR without manual intervention
- Gates may be blocking on approval
- Missing workflows prevent full feature testing

**Mitigation**:
- This is EXPECTED behavior (PR #971 not merged)
- Test documents this limitation
- Recommendation to merge PR #971 will address

---

### 3. Documentation Risk
**Level**: LOW  
**Probability**: <5%  
**Impact**: LOW

**Description**: Risk that test documentation is incomplete or inaccurate

**Factors**:
- ✅ Multiple workflow runs observed
- ✅ Status confirmed via GitHub API
- ✅ File changes verified
- ⚠️ Could not access job logs (0 jobs executed)

**Mitigation**:
- Documented what was observable
- Clearly marked inconclusive findings
- Provided evidence references

---

### 4. Governance Compliance Risk
**Level**: LOW  
**Probability**: <5%  
**Impact**: LOW

**Description**: Risk of violating governance protocols during test

**Assessment**:
- ✅ No contract modifications (SAFE)
- ✅ No Tier-0 canon changes (SAFE)
- ✅ Test change in governance-allowed path (SAFE)
- ✅ Documentation artifacts created (COMPLIANT)

**Mitigation**:
- Following governance-repo-administrator protocol
- Mandatory artifacts being created
- Escalation path identified (CS2 for PR #971 decision)

---

### 5. Merge Risk (PR #973)
**Level**: LOW  
**Probability**: <10%  
**Impact**: LOW

**Description**: Risk related to merging this test PR

**Factors**:
- Test changes are minimal (1 comment)
- Documentation added (test results, scan, risk assessment, etc.)
- Gates not passing (action_required status)

**Mitigation Options**:
1. **Close without merge**: Test complete, PR can be closed
2. **Merge with override**: CS2 can approve despite gate status
3. **Fix gates first**: Merge PR #971, re-run this test

**Recommendation**: Close without merge - test objective achieved

## Risk Matrix

| Risk Category | Probability | Impact | Level | Status |
|---------------|-------------|--------|-------|--------|
| Execution Risk | <5% | Minimal | LOW | ✅ Managed |
| Gate Behavior Risk | 100% | Documentation | MEDIUM | ⚠️ Expected |
| Documentation Risk | <5% | LOW | LOW | ✅ Managed |
| Governance Compliance | <5% | LOW | LOW | ✅ Managed |
| Merge Risk | <10% | LOW | LOW | ✅ Managed |

---

## Residual Risks

### After Test Completion

1. **PR #971 Decision Pending**: CS2 must decide whether to merge
2. **Gate Infrastructure Gap**: Without PR #971, gates lack BL-027/028 features
3. **Future Test Repeatability**: Test may yield different results if PR #971 merged

**Accepted Risks**:
- Gates showing `action_required` status (expected without PR #971)
- Incomplete feature testing (features don't exist without PR #971)

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Test Completion)
1. ✅ Complete mandatory governance artifacts
2. ✅ Document findings in test results
3. ✅ Report progress and close test

### Short-term (CS2 Action Required)
1. **Review PR #971**: Determine why it was closed instead of merged
2. **Decision**: Merge, re-open, or abandon PR #971
3. **If merged**: Re-run this test to verify fixes work

### Long-term (Governance Evolution)
1. **Document BL-027/028**: Capture learnings from this test
2. **Update templates**: If PR #971 merged, update gate documentation
3. **Ripple to consumers**: Share gate fix model with office-app, PartPulse, R_Roster
