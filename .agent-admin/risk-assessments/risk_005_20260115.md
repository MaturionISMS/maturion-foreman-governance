## 4. Risk Categories

### 4.1 Governance Integrity Risks (Current State)

#### Risk R1: Unauthorized Modification of Constitutional Principles
**Description**: Constitutional principles sections (Build Philosophy, Zero Test Debt, etc.) are currently unprotected and could be modified without CS2 approval.

**Likelihood**: HIGH (no technical barriers prevent modification)  
**Impact**: CRITICAL (core governance principles could be weakened or removed)  
**Current Severity**: 🔴 **CATASTROPHIC**

**Affected Sections**:
- agent-contract-administrator: Constitutional Principles (11 principles)
- governance-repo-administrator: Constitutional Principles (8 principles)
- CodexAdvisor: Constitutional Principles (9 principles)

**Scenario**: Agent or contributor modifies constitutional principles section to weaken "Zero Test Debt" requirement, enabling test skipping without CS2 approval.

**Current Mitigation**: ❌ NONE (only social convention and PR review)

**Proposed Mitigation**: 🔒 IMMUTABLE lock with EC-1, EC-6 escalation conditions

---

#### Risk R2: Removal of Prohibitions Enabling Governance Violations
**Description**: Prohibition sections define actions agents must never take. Removing prohibitions would enable governance violations.

**Likelihood**: HIGH (no technical barriers prevent modification)  
**Impact**: CRITICAL (agents could bypass constitutional constraints)  
**Current Severity**: 🔴 **CATASTROPHIC**

**Affected Sections**:
- agent-contract-administrator: Prohibitions (8 rules)
- governance-repo-administrator: Prohibitions (8 rules), Forbidden Actions (9 actions)
- CodexAdvisor: Explicit Prohibitions (5 categories), Prohibitions (8 rules)

**Scenario**: Prohibition against self-modification removed from governance-repo-administrator contract, enabling agent to modify its own contract without CS2 approval.

**Current Mitigation**: ❌ NONE (only contract modification prohibition at end of file)

**Proposed Mitigation**: 🔒 IMMUTABLE lock with EC-1, EC-6 escalation conditions

---

#### Risk R3: Weakening of Handover Requirements
**Description**: Handover requirements (PREHANDOVER_PROOF v2.0.0, evidence artifacts) could be weakened or removed, enabling partial handovers.

**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (requires intent, but no barriers)  
**Impact**: HIGH (constitutional 100% handover principle violated)  
**Current Severity**: 🟠 **HIGH**

**Affected Sections**:
- agent-contract-administrator: Handover Requirements, PREHANDOVER_PROOF, Continuous Improvement
- governance-repo-administrator: Handover Verification, PREHANDOVER_PROOF, Mandatory Enhancement
- CodexAdvisor: PREHANDOVER_PROOF Advisory, Mandatory Enhancement

**Scenario**: PREHANDOVER_PROOF Section 0 (4 governance artifacts) requirement removed, enabling handover without governance scan or risk assessment.

**Current Mitigation**: ⚠️ PARTIAL (Pre-Gate Release Blocking section is locked in agent-contract-administrator)

**Proposed Mitigation**: 🔐 LOCKED-CRITICAL with EC-1, EC-2, EC-6 escalation conditions

---

#### Risk R4: Governance Binding Modification Without Canon Update
**Description**: Governance bindings sections reference canonical governance. Modifications could create binding misalignment with canon.

**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (could happen during "cleanup" or "optimization")  
**Impact**: HIGH (agents would reference wrong/outdated governance)  
**Current Severity**: 🟠 **HIGH**

**Affected Sections**:
- agent-contract-administrator: Governance Bindings (10 canonical documents)
- CodexAdvisor: Canonical Governance Binding (4 documents)

**Scenario**: Binding to MANDATORY_ENHANCEMENT_CAPTURE_STANDARD.md v2.0.0 removed during "contract cleanup", agent no longer aware of continuous improvement requirement.

**Current Mitigation**: ❌ NONE

**Proposed Mitigation**: 🔒 IMMUTABLE lock with EC-1, EC-6 escalation conditions

---

#### Risk R5: Escalation Pathway Removal
**Description**: Escalation protocols define when agents must escalate to CS2. Removal would enable agents to operate without oversight in critical scenarios.

**Likelihood**: LOW (requires malicious intent or severe misunderstanding)  
**Impact**: CRITICAL (agents could bypass CS2 oversight)  
**Current Severity**: 🟠 **HIGH**

**Affected Sections**:
- agent-contract-administrator: Escalate Blockers Immediately, Sandbox & Specialization
- governance-repo-administrator: Escalation Protocol
- CodexAdvisor: Escalation Rules, Uncertainty Protocol

**Scenario**: Escalation requirement for cross-domain work removed from agent-contract-administrator, enabling agent to perform code changes without escalation.

**Current Mitigation**: ❌ NONE

**Proposed Mitigation**: 🔒 IMMUTABLE lock with EC-1, EC-6 escalation conditions

---

#### Risk R6: Agent Self-Modification
**Description**: Agents modifying their own contracts without CS2 approval, enabling unauthorized scope expansion or constraint removal.

**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (explicitly prohibited but only weakly enforced)  
**Impact**: CRITICAL (governance capture, unauthorized authority expansion)  
**Current Severity**: 🔴 **CATASTROPHIC**

**Affected Sections**:
- agent-contract-administrator: Contract Modification Prohibition (already locked ✅)
- governance-repo-administrator: Constitutional Prohibition (minimal, at end)
- CodexAdvisor: Contract Modification Prohibition (minimal, at end)

**Scenario**: CodexAdvisor modifies its own contract to change `execute_changes: false` to `execute_changes: true`, gaining execution authority.

**Current Mitigation**: ⚠️ PARTIAL (1 of 3 contracts has robust protection)

**Proposed Mitigation**: 🔒 IMMUTABLE lock with EC-1 escalation condition (all 3 contracts)

---

#### Risk R7: Authority Boundary Expansion
**Description**: Agent authority boundaries (allowed actions, scope, capabilities) could be expanded without CS2 approval.

**Likelihood**: LOW (requires intent)  
**Impact**: HIGH (agents could gain unauthorized authority)  
**Current Severity**: 🟡 **MEDIUM**

**Affected Sections**:
- governance-repo-administrator: Allowed Actions, Forbidden Actions
- CodexAdvisor: Capabilities, Scope Boundaries

**Scenario**: CodexAdvisor's "Prohibited Access" section modified to allow .github/** access, enabling contract modifications.

**Current Mitigation**: ❌ NONE

**Proposed Mitigation**: 🔒 IMMUTABLE lock for capabilities/scope, 🔐 LOCKED-CRITICAL for allowed actions

---

#### Risk R8: CI Gate Bypass Without Approval
**Description**: Even after lockdown, without CI/CD gate enforcement, LOCKED sections could be modified and merged without detection.

**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (depends on PR review diligence)  
**Impact**: CRITICAL (lockdown protections ineffective)  
**Current Severity**: 🔴 **CATASTROPHIC** (if lockdown implemented without gate)

**Scenario**: PR modifies LOCKED constitutional principles section, reviewers miss locked markers, PR merges without CS2 approval.

**Current Mitigation**: ❌ NONE (no automated gate)

**Proposed Mitigation**: CI/CD gate implementation (Phase 3) blocking LOCKED section modifications

---

### 4.2 Implementation Risks (Lockdown Process)

#### Risk I1: Incorrect Section Identification
**Description**: Wrong sections locked or critical sections missed during lockdown.

**Likelihood**: LOW (comprehensive gap analysis completed)  
**Impact**: MEDIUM (could over-restrict or under-protect)  
**Severity**: 🟡 **MEDIUM**

**Mitigation**: 
- ✅ Comprehensive gap analysis completed (64 sections identified)
- ✅ CS2 review required before implementation
- ✅ Section-by-section audit in GAP_ANALYSIS.md

---

#### Risk I2: Lock Marker Syntax Errors
**Description**: Incorrect `<!-- LOCKED SECTION -->` marker syntax or placement could break parsing or cause confusion.

**Likelihood**: LOW (using standard HTML comment syntax)  
**Impact**: LOW (easily detected and corrected)  
**Severity**: 🟢 **LOW**

**Mitigation**:
- Standard HTML comment syntax
- Consistent placement (before section, after section)
- Visual review during implementation
- CI gate will validate marker syntax (Phase 3)

---

#### Risk I3: Protection Registry Errors
**Description**: Protection Registry entries could have incorrect data (section location, escalation conditions, etc.).

**Likelihood**: LOW (data from gap analysis)  
**Impact**: LOW (documentation issue, not enforcement issue)  
**Severity**: 🟢 **LOW**

**Mitigation**:
- Generate registry entries from gap analysis data
- Manual verification during implementation
- CS2 review of registries

---

#### Risk I4: Version Conflict
**Description**: Version increments could conflict with other in-flight contract changes.

**Likelihood**: LOW (governance repo has controlled change management)  
**Impact**: LOW (version number conflict, easily resolved)  
**Severity**: 🟢 **LOW**

**Mitigation**:
- Check for other open PRs before version increment
- Use next available minor version
- Document version change in changelog

---

### 4.3 Operational Risks (Post-Lockdown)

#### Risk O1: Legitimate Change Process Slowed
**Description**: Lockdown might slow legitimate contract changes by requiring CS2 approval.

**Likelihood**: HIGH (by design - CS2 approval required for LOCKED sections)  
**Impact**: LOW (governance discipline requires formal process)  
**Severity**: 🟢 **LOW** (Not a bug, it's a feature)

**Mitigation**:
- Clear escalation conditions documented (EC-1 through EC-7)
- Escalation instruction templates available
- CS2 review process well-defined
- **Note**: This is intentional governance discipline, not a negative risk

---

#### Risk O2: Over-Locking Reducing Contract Flexibility
**Description**: Too many sections locked could make contracts inflexible to legitimate evolution.

**Likelihood**: LOW (only constitutional/critical sections locked)  
**Impact**: LOW (escalation conditions allow legitimate changes)  
**Severity**: 🟢 **LOW**

**Mitigation**:
- Only IMMUTABLE, LOCKED-CRITICAL, LOCKED-STANDARD sections locked
- Informational sections remain unlocked (22 sections across 3 contracts)
- EC-2, EC-3, EC-6 allow legitimate evolution
- Protection levels calibrated to section criticality

---

#### Risk O3: False Positive Gate Blocks
**Description**: CI/CD gate might block legitimate changes due to false positive detection.

**Likelihood**: LOW (with proper gate design)  
**Impact**: LOW (manual CS2 override available)  
**Severity**: 🟢 **LOW**

**Mitigation**:
- Gate design includes CS2 override label
- Clear gate failure messages
- Documentation for resolving false positives
- Gate testing in Phase 3

---

### 4.4 Downstream Ripple Risks

#### Risk D1: Consumer Repository Confusion
**Description**: Downstream repositories (office-app, PartPulse, R_Roster) might not understand lockdown protocol when proposing governance changes.

**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (new process, requires communication)  
**Impact**: LOW (impacts process, not governance integrity)  
**Severity**: 🟡 **MEDIUM**

**Mitigation**:
- Documentation in GAP_ANALYSIS.md (in governance repo)
- Escalation instruction templates available
- Clear error messages from CI gate
- Communication to downstream repository maintainers

---

#### Risk D2: Governance Binding Staleness
**Description**: Locked governance bindings in downstream contracts might become stale if canonical documents update.

**Likelihood**: LOW (governance versioning protocol exists)  
**Impact**: MEDIUM (downstream agents referencing outdated governance)  
**Severity**: 🟡 **MEDIUM**

**Mitigation**:
- Governance versioning protocol (GOVERNANCE_VERSIONING_AND_SYNC_PROTOCOL.md)
- Ripple model for propagating updates
- EC-6 escalation condition for upstream canon updates
- Version fields in governance bindings
