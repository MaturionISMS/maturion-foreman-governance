# Risk Assessment: v1.2.0 Agent Contract Alignment

**Risk Assessment ID**: risk_001_20260113  
**Date**: 2026-01-13  
**Agent**: agent-contract-administrator  
**Task**: Align all governance repository agent contracts with AGENT_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL v1.2.0

---

## Repository Context

**Repository**: APGI-cmy/maturion-foreman-governance  
**Type**: CANONICAL GOVERNANCE SOURCE (highest authority)  
**Branch**: copilot/align-agent-contracts-to-v1-2-0  
**Agents in Repository**: 3 (governance-repo-administrator, CodexAdvisor, agent-contract-administrator)

---

## Agent Context

### Agents to be Modified

1. **governance-repo-administrator.agent.md**
   - Current Version: 2.2.0
   - Role: Governance repository administrator
   - Authority: Governance canon administration within this repo
   - Criticality: HIGH (manages canonical governance)

2. **CodexAdvisor-agent.md**
   - Current Version: 1.2
   - Role: Advisory agent (read-only, advisory-only)
   - Authority: None (advisory only, zero execution authority)
   - Criticality: LOW (advisory only, no execution)

3. **agent-contract-administrator.md**
   - Current Version: 1.2.0
   - Status: NO CHANGES REQUIRED (already compliant)
   - Note: Constitutional prohibition prevents self-modification

---

## Risk Categories

### 1. Governance Compliance Risk

**Risk**: Updates may introduce governance conflicts or contradictions

**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: HIGH  
**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Governance scan completed - no conflicts identified
- ✅ Changes align with AGENT_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md v1.0.0
- ✅ All changes are constitutional alignment (strengthening, not weakening)
- ✅ No execution authority changes (only documentation/format)

**Residual Risk**: MINIMAL

---

### 2. Contract Validity Risk

**Risk**: Modified contracts may violate .agent.schema.md or become invalid

**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: MEDIUM  
**Mitigation**:
- Adding sections (Constitutional Prohibition) to enhance compliance
- Converting to YAML (already YAML in most cases, just ensuring consistency)
- Adding constitutional principles (documentation improvement)
- No removal of required fields or sections
- Changes follow established patterns from consumer repos

**Residual Risk**: MINIMAL

---

### 3. Agent Functionality Risk

**Risk**: Contract changes may affect agent operational capability

**Likelihood**: VERY LOW  
**Impact**: MEDIUM  
**Mitigation**:
- Changes are primarily additive (adding sections, clarifying prohibitions)
- No authority removal or capability restrictions
- governance-repo-administrator maintains all existing capabilities
- CodexAdvisor already has zero execution authority (no change)
- Format conversions (YAML) don't affect semantics
- All operational protocols remain intact

**Residual Risk**: MINIMAL

---

### 4. Downstream Ripple Risk

**Risk**: Changes here may create expectations for consumer repositories

**Likelihood**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: LOW  
**Mitigation**:
- This repository is the CANONICAL SOURCE - setting standards is the purpose
- Consumer repos (office-app, PartPulse, R_Roster) already aligned to v1.2.0
- These changes bring governance repo to same standard as consumers (catching up)
- No breaking changes to contract format or structure
- Patterns established here are already in use elsewhere

**Residual Risk**: ACCEPTABLE (intended effect - establishing gold standard)

---

### 5. Self-Modification Risk

**Risk**: Agent Contract Administrator modifying its own contract

**Likelihood**: ZERO (blocked by constitutional prohibition)  
**Impact**: CATASTROPHIC (if it happened)  
**Mitigation**:
- ✅ agent-contract-administrator.md already at v1.2.0
- ✅ NO CHANGES to agent-contract-administrator.md required
- ✅ Constitutional prohibition explicitly prevents self-modification
- ✅ This assessment confirms compliance with prohibition

**Residual Risk**: ZERO (not applicable to this task)

---

### 6. Version Management Risk

**Risk**: Incorrect version bumping or changelog documentation

**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: LOW  
**Mitigation**:
- governance-repo-administrator: Version 2.2.0 → 2.3.0 (MINOR bump, constitutional alignment)
- CodexAdvisor: Version 1.2 → 1.3.0 (MINOR bump, constitutional alignment)
- Changelog entries will explicitly document constitutional alignment
- All version changes follow semantic versioning for governance contracts

**Residual Risk**: MINIMAL

---

### 7. Documentation Completeness Risk

**Risk**: Incomplete or ambiguous constitutional language

**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: MEDIUM  
**Mitigation**:
- Using established templates from consumer repos
- Following exact patterns from AGENT_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md
- Absolute language ("MUST NOT", "CANNOT", "CATASTROPHIC")
- Clear CAN/CANNOT scope clarification
- Explicit instruction system process documentation

**Residual Risk**: MINIMAL

## Change Impact Matrix

| Change Type | governance-repo-admin | CodexAdvisor | Impact Level |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Add Constitutional Prohibition | YES | Enhance | HIGH (strengthens) |
| YAML Bindings Format | Already YAML | Already YAML | NONE (verify only) |
| Constitutional Principle #11 | Add explicit | Add explicit | LOW (clarification) |
| Prohibition #8 | Add explicit | Add explicit | LOW (clarification) |
| Version Bump | 2.2.0 → 2.3.0 | 1.2 → 1.3.0 | LOW (documentation) |
| Changelog Entry | Add v2.3.0 | Add v1.3.0 | LOW (documentation) |

## Approval and Authorization

**Authority for Changes**: AGENT_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md (Tier-0, Constitutional)

**Instruction System Compliance**:
- Task assigned via GitHub issue (formal instruction)
- Changes align with constitutional mandate
- CS2 authorization implicit in issue creation
- Changes are constitutional alignment (not new authority grants)

**Agent Authority**:
- ✅ Agent Contract Administrator has authority to modify .agent files
- ✅ Changes are within scope (governance repo contracts)
- ✅ Self-modification prohibition respected (no changes to own contract)

---

## Validation Plan

### Pre-Change Validation
- ✅ Governance scan completed
- ✅ Risk assessment completed
- ✅ No conflicts with canonical governance
- ✅ Changes align with v1.2.0 requirements

### Post-Change Validation
- ⏳ Verify YAML syntax validity
- ⏳ Verify all required sections present
- ⏳ Verify version numbers updated correctly
- ⏳ Verify changelog entries accurate
- ⏳ Verify Constitutional Prohibition sections complete
- ⏳ Git diff review (only intended changes)
- ⏳ Create change record documentation
- ⏳ Create completion summary

3. No authority changes or capability modifications
4. Patterns already proven in consumer repositories
5. Self-modification prohibition respected
6. Governance scan shows no conflicts
7. Changes establish gold standard for canonical source

**Conditions**:
- Complete post-change validation checklist
- Document all changes in change record
