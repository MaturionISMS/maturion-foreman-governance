# Pilot Build Notes

This file is used by Foreman's Pilot Build Wave to validate the end-to-end build pipeline.

## Purpose

The Pilot Build Wave is a controlled, small-scale build that validates:
- Chat → Foreman reasoning
- Foreman → Builder routing (Copilot / Local Builder)
- File changes in a real repo
- QA execution
- PR creation
- Status streaming back into the chat UI
