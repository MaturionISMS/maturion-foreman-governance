# QII Incident Consolidation - Execution Summary

**Issue Reference:** #256 - QIC/QIEL/QII INCIDENT CONSOLIDATION & REMOVAL  
**Date:** 2025-12-08  
**Status:** Ready for Execution

---

## Overview

This document summarizes the QII (Quality Integrity Incident) consolidation effort to remove all 35 auto-generated incident issues that represent environmental misalignment, which has now been resolved.

## What Was Done

### 1. Issue Analysis ✅

**Search Criteria Used:**
- `label:quality-integrity is:open`
- `label:qic-incident is:open` (0 results)
- `label:qii is:open` (0 results)  
- `label:qiel-failure is:open` (0 results)
- `label:qa-incident is:open` (0 results)

**Result:** Found 35 open issues, all with the `quality-integrity` label

### 2. Issue Validation ✅

All 35 issues were validated as:
- ✅ Auto-generated by `github-actions[bot]`
- ✅ Related to environmental misalignment (not functional issues)
- ✅ Labeled with `quality-integrity`, `qiel`, and `automated`
- ✅ Title pattern: `🚨 Quality Integrity Incident - [branch] - [commit]`
- ✅ Created between 2025-12-07 and 2025-12-08

**No functional issues were identified for removal.**

### 3. Artifacts Created ✅

1. **QII_INCIDENT_CLOSURE_REPORT.md**
   - Comprehensive closure report
   - Full list of 35 issues to close
   - Validation criteria
   - Closure procedure options

2. **scripts/close-qii-incidents.sh**
   - Executable bash script for automated closure
   - Supports `--dry-run` mode for testing
   - Includes rate limiting
   - Adds closure comment to each issue

3. **scripts/close-qii-incidents.ts**
   - TypeScript documentation script
   - Programmatic issue list
   - Closure comment template
   - Report generation function

## What Needs to Be Done

### Execute the Closure Script

The bash script is ready to execute but requires GitHub API authentication. Someone with repository write access needs to run:

```bash
# Step 1: Test with dry run
cd /home/runner/work/maturion-foreman-app/maturion-foreman-app
./scripts/close-qii-incidents.sh --dry-run

# Step 2: Execute closure (after dry run validates correctly)
./scripts/close-qii-incidents.sh
```

### Alternative: Manual Execution

If the script cannot be used, issues can be closed manually using GitHub CLI:

```bash
# For each issue number: 239, 237, 234, 231, 230, 227, 224, 223, 222, 221,
# 220, 219, 218, 215, 214, 213, 212, 209, 208, 207, 206, 203, 202, 200, 
# 199, 198, 197, 195, 192, 191, 186, 184, 183, 182, 180

gh issue close <NUMBER> --repo MaturionISMS/maturion-foreman-app --comment "<CLOSURE_COMMENT>"
```

See `QII_INCIDENT_CLOSURE_REPORT.md` for the complete closure comment template.

## Acceptance Criteria Status

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| All incident issues identified | ✅ COMPLETE | 35 issues found |
| Validate legacy environment divergence | ✅ COMPLETE | All issues validated |
| Script/process to close issues | ✅ COMPLETE | Scripts created |
| Closure comment prepared | ✅ COMPLETE | Template ready |
| No governance violations | ✅ COMPLETE | No functional issues |
| Execute closure | ⏳ PENDING | Requires GitHub API auth |
| Verify closure (expected: 35) | ⏳ PENDING | After execution |
| No functional issues removed | ✅ COMPLETE | Validated |
| Only build/governance issues remain | ✅ COMPLETE | Validated |

## Post-Execution Verification

After executing the closure script, verify success with:

```bash
# Should return 0 results
gh issue list --repo MaturionISMS/maturion-foreman-app --label quality-integrity --state open

# Count closed issues (should be 35)
gh issue list --repo MaturionISMS/maturion-foreman-app --label quality-integrity --state closed | wc -l
```

## Issue List (35 Total)

All issues follow the pattern: `🚨 Quality Integrity Incident - [branch] - [commit]`

## Resolution Statement

All issues will be closed with the status:

> **Resolved via QIEL Environment Alignment + Drift Detector Enforcement**

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Complete:** Issue analysis and script preparation
2. ⏳ **Pending:** Execute closure script (requires GitHub API auth)
3. ⏳ **Pending:** Verify all 35 issues closed
4. ⏳ **Pending:** Proceed to Issue #258 (Issue Index Rebuild & Dependency Normalization)

## Notes

- The Copilot agent does not have GitHub API permissions to close issues directly
- A human with repository write access must execute the closure script
- The script includes dry-run mode for safety verification before actual execution
- All closure operations include proper documentation and traceability
