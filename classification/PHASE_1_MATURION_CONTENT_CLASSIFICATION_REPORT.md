**Key Findings**:
- **190 total open issues** in FM App backlog requiring normalization
- **50+ canonical vision/doctrine documents** identified in `maturion/` directory
- **Comprehensive execution strategy artifacts** including backlog cleanup and wave sequencing
- **Extensive operational memory** in evidence archives and memory fabric
- **Clear dependency chains** established for safe migration
- **Zero content loss risk** - all artifacts accounted for and classified

- Wave model and execution rules
- Builder constitutional systems
- Non-negotiable execution invariants
- Quality governance rules

**Category C: Operational Memory (FM App)**  
Execution-time intelligence and learnings:

- Decisions taken during execution
- Regressions encountered and resolved
- Cost/effort tradeoffs documented
- Wave execution outcomes and metrics

**Category D: Legacy / Obsolete**

## Risk & Dependency Analysis

### Critical Dependency Chains

#### Chain 1: Vision → Execution Canon → Operational Memory
**Flow**: 
1. Maturion True North and Identity define vision
2. Build Philosophy and Constitutional Systems define execution rules
3. Wave sequencing and backlog cleanup operationalize execution
4. Build history and evidence capture outcomes

**Risk**: Breaking this chain by misplacing canonical vision or execution doctrine would prevent FM from understanding its purpose and constraints.

**Mitigation**: Maintain clear references from FM App operational memory back to Governance canon.

#### Chain 2: Memory Architecture → Memory Implementation → Memory Evidence
**Flow**:
1. Maturion Memory Architecture defines memory tiers (canonical)
2. Memory Fabric V1 implements the architecture
3. Wave 1 execution evidence documents the implementation
4. Operational memory captures ongoing usage

**Risk**: Separating architectural vision from implementation evidence could lead to drift.

**Mitigation**: Memory architecture should be canonized in Governance with clear references from FM App implementation documentation.

#### Chain 3: Builder Constitutional Systems → Builder Implementation → Builder Evidence
**Flow**:
1. Wave 0 builder constitutional systems (issues #240-#242) define governance-aligned reasoning, handover contracts, and memory protection
2. Builder runtime implementation realizes these constitutional requirements
3. Build evidence captures constitutional compliance

**Risk**: Losing constitutional requirements would allow builders to drift from governance alignment.

**Mitigation**: Builder constitutional systems must be strongly canonized in Governance with enforcement mechanisms.

### Intent Loss Risk Areas

#### High Risk Areas (Require Special Treatment)

1. **Backlog Cleanup & Execution Plan**
   - **Artifacts**: `BACKLOG_CLEANUP_REPORT.md`, `CANONICAL_BACKLOG_SEQUENCE.md`
   - **Risk**: These represent the first normalization of vision into executable work. Losing these would require re-discovering the execution strategy.
   - **Mitigation**: Migrate to FM App with governance references. Consider extracting wave sequencing principles to Governance canon.

2. **Execution Halt Reports**
   - **Artifacts**: `ANNEX_1_EXECUTION_HALT_REPORT.md`
   - **Risk**: Documents critical constitutional compliance enforcement (Zero Test Debt). Demonstrates governance supremacy in action.
   - **Mitigation**: Migrate to FM App as operational evidence, but extract constitutional compliance patterns to Governance learning memory.

3. **MCP to FM Transition**
   - **Artifacts**: All MCP-related architecture and guides
   - **Risk**: MCP was replaced by FM. The transition reasoning and lessons must be preserved even as artifacts are retired.
   - **Mitigation**: Extract lessons learned about why MCP failed and why FM succeeded. Store in Governance memory before retiring MCP artifacts.

#### Medium Risk Areas

1. **Platform Tree Vision**
   - **Artifacts**: All `platform-tree-*` documents
   - **Risk**: Platform Tree was early visualization vision. Governance and risk overlay principles are valuable even if implementation is retired.
   - **Mitigation**: Extract governance patterns and hierarchical risk visualization principles before retiring.

2. **Memory Fabric Implementation**
   - **Artifacts**: Memory Fabric architecture and implementation reports
   - **Risk**: Separating canonical memory tier definitions from implementation evidence.
   - **Mitigation**: Canonize memory architecture in Governance, keep implementation evidence in FM App with clear references.

### Artifacts Requiring Partial Canon + Partial Memory

| Artifact | Canon Component | Memory Component | Handling |
|----------|----------------|------------------|----------|
| `maturion-memory-architecture.md` | Memory tier definitions (STM, WM, EM, SM, LTM) | Implementation patterns and performance characteristics | Split: Canon in Governance, implementation reference in FM App |
| `maturion-runtime-spec.md` | Runtime requirements and embodiment rules | Runtime performance and operational characteristics | Split: Canon requirements in Governance, operational specs in FM App |
| `MEMORY_FABRIC_V1.md` | Memory fabric architecture principles | Implementation details and API specifications | Split: Canon architecture in Governance, implementation in FM App |
| `PHASE3_BUILDER_ECOSYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` | Builder ecosystem principles and governance | Builder implementation details and operational patterns | Split: Canon principles in Governance, implementation in FM App |

## Recommended Migration Sequences

### Phase 2: Canonization into Governance (Future Work)

**MANDATORY CANONIZATION METHOD**: Phase 2 work MUST follow the canonization method and source handling protocol defined by Johan Ras in PR comment #3685180442. This includes:
- Authoritative input sources (Categories A and B from this Phase 1 report)
- Source review protocol (read in full, extract intent, discard noise)
- Synthesis rules (rewrite, don't copy; timeless language)
- Archived material handling (intent survives, mechanisms don't)
- Fidelity and traceability (record source basis for each canonical file)
- Conflict resolution (escalate unresolvable conflicts)
- Completion check (every canonical file lists source basis)

**Canonization Output**: All canonical files created in Phase 2 MUST be documented in `governance/reports/PHASE_2_CANONIZATION_SUMMARY.md` with full source traceability.

**Priority 1 - Core Vision Documents** (Must canonize first):
1. Maturion True North
2. Maturion Identity
3. Maturion Philosophy Tree
4. Maturion Governance Constitution
5. Build Philosophy (already in place)
6. Technology Evolution Doctrine
7. Guardrails and Safety Charter
8. Oversight System

**Priority 2 - Execution Canon** (Canonize after vision):
1. Wave 0 Builder Constitutional Systems (#240-#242)
2. Memory Architecture (canonical tier definitions)
3. Runtime Specification (canonical requirements)
4. Builder Runtime Specification
5. Wave Execution Model
6. Multi-Repo Governance
7. Recovery and Resilience Requirements

**Priority 3 - Governance Policies** (Canonize after execution canon):
1. Constitutional Integrity Verification
2. Cognitive Hygiene Protocol
3. Knowledge Boundary Reinforcement
4. Tenant Isolation Standard
5. Cost Optimization Policy
6. Incident Taxonomy
7. Change Management Protocol

### Phase 3: FM Operational Memory Migration (Future Work)

1. Backlog Cleanup Report
2. Canonical Backlog Sequence
3. Execution Halt Reports
4. Memory Fabric Implementation Reports
5. Wave Execution Summaries

**Priority 2 - Build Evidence** (Migrate after critical history):
1. All build-history archive content
2. Test dodging resolution evidence
3. Wave completion evidence
4. QA validation evidence
5. Security summaries

**Priority 3 - Operational Memory Systems** (Migrate after evidence):
1. Memory Fabric operational documentation
2. Foreman memory scope documentation
3. Project memory
4. Lessons learned

### Phase 4: Legacy Retirement & Validation (Future Work)

**MCP Retirement**:
1. Extract lessons learned about MCP failure
2. Document why FM succeeded where MCP failed
3. Store lessons in Governance memory
4. Retire all MCP artifacts

**Platform Tree Retirement**:
1. Extract governance and visualization principles
2. Document hierarchical risk overlay concepts
3. Store principles in Governance memory
4. Retire Platform Tree implementation artifacts

**Duplicate Consolidation**:
1. Merge duplicate TED documents
2. Consolidate wave documentation
3. Merge overlapping specifications

- Hierarchical governance visualization is valuable
- Risk overlay concepts apply beyond Platform Tree
- Watchdog visualization principles remain relevant

**Governance Impact**: Future visualization work should...
- Use hierarchical governance models
- Maintain risk overlay capabilities

### Zero Test Debt Enforcement

**Lesson**: Annex 1 execution halt demonstrated...
- Constitutional compliance enforcement works
- Zero Test Debt rule is enforceable
- Execution must stop when governance violations occur

**Governance Impact**: Future enforcement must...
- Maintain Zero Test Debt absoluteness
- Enforce constitutional halts
- Preserve governance supremacy
