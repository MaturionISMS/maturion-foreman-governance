# Governance Source Declaration

This directory contains an operational mirror of governance philosophy.

Authoritative source of truth:
- Repository: maturion-codex-control
- Path: governance/philosophy/

This repository exists to make governance readable and enforceable by
execution agents (e.g. Codex).

Any divergence between this mirror and the authoritative source
constitutes a Governance Incident and must be escalated.
