# Enhancement Proposal: Ripple-Wave 1.2 Completion

**Status**: PARKED — NOT AUTHORIZED FOR EXECUTION  
**Date**: 2026-01-02  
**Source**: Ripple-Wave 1.2 — Agent Mindset Alignment work unit  
**Category**: Future Wave Planning

## Context

During Ripple-Wave 1.2, the following conceptual and definitional work was completed:
- Agent ripple awareness obligation defined
- Agent recruitment and contract authority model clarified
- Draft agent language prepared for future activation

This work revealed several potential enhancements for future waves.

---

## Potential Enhancements

### Enhancement 1: Ripple Impact Visualization

**Observation**: During the definition of ripple awareness obligations, it became clear that **visual representation** of ripple propagation could significantly improve agent understanding of cross-boundary impact.

**Potential Future Work** (requires authorization):
- Develop visual diagrams showing ripple flow from governance changes
- Create interactive ripple impact maps for complex changes
- Build dependency graphs showing which artifacts reference which governance files

**Benefit**: Visual representation would make ripple awareness more concrete and actionable for agents.

**Parking Rationale**: Visualization is tooling/automation, out of scope for Wave 1.2 (mindset alignment only).

---

### Enhancement 2: Ripple Detection Assistance (Reporting Only)

**Observation**: While agents are now obligated to identify ripples, **automated assistance** could improve ripple detection completeness and accuracy.

**Potential Future Work** (requires authorization):
- Static analysis tools to identify cross-file references
- Schema dependency tracking to detect breaking changes
- Agent contract impact analysis for governance changes
- **Note**: All assistance would be **reporting only**, not enforcement

**Benefit**: Reduces manual effort for ripple identification while maintaining agent responsibility for surfacing ripples.

**Parking Rationale**: This is explicitly planned for Ripple-Wave 2+, requires tooling work.

---

### Enhancement 3: Ripple Coordination Protocol

**Observation**: High-impact ripples require **cross-agent coordination**. A formal protocol could streamline this coordination.

**Potential Future Work** (requires authorization):
- Define coordination workflow for breaking changes
- Establish ripple notification mechanism (Governance Agent → FM → Builders)
- Create coordination checklist for ecosystem-wide changes
- Define migration path templates for breaking schema changes

**Benefit**: Reduces friction in coordinating high-impact changes across multiple repos/agents.

**Parking Rationale**: Coordination protocol would benefit from real-world experience with ripple awareness before formalization.

---

### Enhancement 4: Agent Contract Synchronization Automation

**Observation**: FM is responsible for updating builder/liaison contracts when governance ripples require it. **Partial automation** could reduce manual effort while preserving human oversight.

**Potential Future Work** (requires authorization):
- Automated contract diff generation when canon changes
- Contract update proposal generation (for FM review/approval)
- Cross-repo contract consistency validation
- **Note**: Automation would propose updates, FM approves and applies

**Benefit**: Reduces FM manual effort in identifying contract update needs.

**Parking Rationale**: Automation is out of scope for Wave 1.2, requires implementation work.

---

### Enhancement 5: Ripple Learning Feedback Loop

**Observation**: As agents practice ripple awareness, **patterns of missed ripples** or **unanticipated ripples** will emerge. Capturing these learnings could improve ripple classification.

**Potential Future Work** (requires authorization):
- Ripple miss tracking (ripples not identified by agent, discovered later)
- Unanticipated ripple catalog (ripples not in trigger classification)
- Periodic review of ripple patterns to update `RIPPLE_INTELLIGENCE_LAYER.md` trigger classification
- Learning promotion to improve ripple awareness obligation

**Benefit**: Continuous improvement of ripple intelligence model based on execution experience.

**Parking Rationale**: Learning loop requires operational experience before implementation.

## Explicit Non-Authorization Statement

**These enhancements are PARKED and NOT AUTHORIZED FOR EXECUTION.**

Activation of any enhancement requires:
- Explicit authorization from Johan Ras (Maturion proxy)
- Separate work unit definition
- Governance review and approval
- Integration with existing governance models
