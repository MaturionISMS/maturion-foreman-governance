    - Emergency Self-Review Issue (2026-01-14)
  reason: |
    Emergency self-review identified critical gaps in contract protection mechanisms:
    1. No explicit "no removal" rule preventing deletion of critical safeguards
    2. No LOCKED metadata protecting constitutional sections from unauthorized modification
    3. No audit trail requirements for changes to protected sections
    4. No enumeration of which sections are constitutionally critical
    
    Without these protections, future contract modifications could remove or weaken
    critical safeguards (Handover Verification Protocol, PREHANDOVER_PROOF requirements,
    Constitutional Prohibition) through instruction system, bypassing governance oversight.
    
    This instruction restores protection mechanisms to prevent catastrophic governance
    circumvention.

changes:
  - change_id: CHANGE-001
    change_type: addition
    section_affected: NEW - "Protection Against Removal or Weakening of Safeguards"

    description: |
      Add comprehensive "Protection Against Removal or Weakening of Safeguards" section
      establishing explicit rule that critical safeguards cannot be removed, weakened,
      or bypassed without CS2 approval and documented governance justification.
      
      This section creates "no removal" governance rule addressing Gap #1 from self-review.
    
    constitutional_justification: |
      AGENT_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md establishes single-writer pattern (only Agent
      Contract Administrator can modify contracts) but does NOT specify what modifications
      are prohibited. This creates ambiguity allowing approved instructions to remove
      critical safeguards.
      
      EXECUTION_BOOTSTRAP_PROTOCOL.md requires handover verification but doesn't protect
      those requirements from future removal.
      
      Emergency Self-Review Issue requires explicit "no removal without formal change
      management" rule to prevent silent deletion of safeguards during contract updates.
    
    safeguard_impact: PROTECTIVE - Adds new safeguard, does not weaken existing

    description: |
      Add LOCKED metadata HTML comments to 6 critical sections marking them as requiring
      elevated change authority and CS2 approval for modifications.
      
      Metadata format: <!-- LOCKED: true | CHANGE_AUTHORITY: CS2 | LAST_REVIEW: YYYY-MM-DD | [CONTEXT] -->
    
    constitutional_justification: |
      Emergency Self-Review Issue explicitly requires LOCKED: true metadata block to
      permanently protect critical sections until/unless change-managed.
    
    safeguard_impact: PROTECTIVE - Adds protection metadata, does not modify section content
