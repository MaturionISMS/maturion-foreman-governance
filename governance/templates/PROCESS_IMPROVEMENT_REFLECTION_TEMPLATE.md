# Process Improvement Reflection — [Work Unit Title]

**Work Unit**: [Brief description or issue/PR number]  
**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Agent**: [Agent name/role]  
**Authority**: `governance/canon/MANDATORY_PROCESS_IMPROVEMENT_REFLECTION_PROTOCOL.md`

---

## Question 1: What went well in this work unit?

[Identify governance processes, templates, tools, or canon elements that enabled success. Highlight which aspects should be preserved or amplified in future governance work. Minimum 2-3 sentences.]

**Key Strengths:**
- [Specific process, tool, or governance element that worked well]
- [Another strength to preserve]

---

## Question 2: What failed, was blocked, or required rework?

[Document any failures, blockers, or rework cycles, with root causes. Include governance gaps, tooling limitations, ambiguous specifications, or cross-repo coordination issues. If no failures occurred, explain why with context. Minimum 2-3 sentences.]

**Failures/Blockers:**
- [Specific failure or blocker with root cause]
- [Another failure or blocker]

**OR**

No failures or blockers were encountered. [Provide context: Why was this work unit straightforward? What enabled smooth execution?]

---

## Question 3: What process, governance, or tooling changes would have improved this work unit or prevented waste?

[Propose specific improvements that would have reduced friction or prevented rework. Identify friction points in workflow, escalation, verification, or evidence recording. Suggest concrete prevention mechanisms. Minimum 2-3 sentences.]

**Proposed Improvements:**
- **[Improvement Category]**: [Specific proposal with rationale]
- **[Improvement Category]**: [Specific proposal with rationale]

**OR**

No process improvements identified for this work unit. [Justify why: Was this a one-time situation? Were existing processes sufficient?]

---

## Question 4: Did you comply with all relevant governance learnings (BLs / bootstrap learnings)?

[Check compliance with active Bootstrap Learnings from `governance/canon/BOOTSTRAP_EXECUTION_LEARNINGS.md`. For each applicable BL, state COMPLIANT or NON-COMPLIANT with justification.]

**BL Compliance Verification:**

- **BL-016 (FM Complexity Recognition)**: [COMPLIANT / NOT APPLICABLE / NON-COMPLIANT]
  - [Justification or explanation]

- **BL-018 (QA Catalog Alignment)**: [COMPLIANT / NOT APPLICABLE / NON-COMPLIANT]
  - [Justification or explanation]

- **BL-019 (Forward-Scan Obligation)**: [COMPLIANT / NOT APPLICABLE / NON-COMPLIANT]
  - [Justification or explanation]

- **BL-022 (Constitutional Sandbox)**: [COMPLIANT / NOT APPLICABLE / NON-COMPLIANT]
  - [Justification or explanation]

- **Other Active BLs**: [List any other applicable BL entries]
  - [Compliance status and justification]

**Verdict**: [COMPLIANT / NON-COMPLIANT]

**If NON-COMPLIANT:**
- **STOP IMMEDIATELY**
- **Escalate to**: [Maturion / FM / Governance Administrator]
- **Reason for Non-Compliance**: [Detailed explanation]
- **Corrective Action Required**: [Specific remediation steps]

---

## Question 5: What actionable improvement should be layered up to governance canon or processes for future prevention?

[Propose concrete governance/process changes suitable for canonization or policy update. Identify whether this should be a new canonical document, an update to existing canon, a new template, a CI/CD gate modification, a Bootstrap Learning entry, OR justify why no upstream change is warranted.]

**Proposed Canonical Changes:**

- **[Change Type: Canon Update / New Document / Template / CI Gate / BL Entry]**: [Specific proposal]
  - **Rationale**: [Why this change would prevent future issues]
  - **BL Promotion Consideration**: [YES / NO with justification]

**OR**

No upstream governance changes warranted for this work unit. [Justify: Why is this a one-time situation unlikely to recur?]
