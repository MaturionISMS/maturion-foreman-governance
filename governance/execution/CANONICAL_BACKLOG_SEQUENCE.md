## Purpose

This document formalizes the execution sequence derived from backlog normalization and cleanup. It defines the canonical wave-based sequencing for all Maturion Foreman App development.

## Principles

### Wave-Based Execution
Execution is organized into discrete waves with:
- Clear boundaries and dependencies
- Measurable completion criteria
- Cumulative quality guarantees
- Regression prevention
- Autonomous execution

### Dependency Respect
- Wave N cannot start until Wave N-1 dependencies are met
- Dependencies are analyzed, not assumed
- Cross-wave dependencies are explicitly documented

### Constitutional Foundation First
- Wave 0 (Builder Constitutional Systems) MUST precede all execution waves
- Cannot build at scale without constitutional foundation
- Governance systems enable safe autonomous execution

---

## Wave Structure

### Wave 0: Builder Constitutional Systems (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Purpose**: Establish constitutional foundation for safe autonomous builder operations.

**Must complete BEFORE any builder operations at scale.**

#### Foundation Layer (Complete First)
- **#240**: Governance-Aligned Builder Reasoning Blueprint
- **#241**: Strict Builder Handover Contract (SBHC)
- **#251**: Builder Protocol-Level Safety Kernel (BPSK)

#### Safety & Protection Layer
- **#242**: Builder Memory Constitutional Protection (BMCP)
- **#249**: Builder Constitutional Robotics Layer (BCRL)
- **#252**: Builder Failure Recovery Kernel (BFRK)
- **#253**: Builder Constitutional Checkpointing System (BCCS)

#### Cognitive Governance Layer
- **#244**: Builder Cognitive Discipline Engine (BCDE)
- **#247**: Builder Cognitive Constraint Engine (BCCE)
- **#248**: Builder Emotional Neutrality & Bias Guard (BENBG)

#### Monitoring & Analytics Layer
- **#243**: Governance-Aligned Builder Simulation Sandbox (GABSS)
- **#245**: Builder Memory Audit Dashboard
- **#246**: Builder Handover & Discipline Analytics

**Rationale**: These systems ensure all builder operations maintain constitutional compliance, prevent cognitive drift, and enforce governance supremacy. They form the constitutional foundation for safe autonomous builder execution.

### Wave 0.5: Critical Governance Systems

**Purpose**: Establish additional governance infrastructure.

- **#236**: Constitutional Hash Verification Layer (CHVL)

## Execution Rules

### Wave Completion Criteria
A wave is complete when:
- All issues in the wave are 100% GREEN
- All previous wave QA still passes (cumulative QA)
- All governance gates pass
- Evidence trail is complete
- No test debt exists

### Wave Progression Rules
1. **Sequential Execution**: Waves execute in order (0 → 1 → 2 → ...)
2. **No Skipping**: Cannot skip waves
3. **Dependency Blocking**: Missing dependency blocks wave start
4. **Cumulative QA**: All past wave QA runs with each new wave
5. **Autonomous Continuation**: Waves execute without pause unless governance blocks

### Issue Lifecycle Within Wave
```
ISSUE SELECTED → ARCHITECTURE → RED QA → BUILD TO GREEN → VALIDATION → MERGE → COMPLETE
```

Each issue follows full OPOJD lifecycle before next issue starts.

---

## Quality Guarantees

### Per Wave
- 100% GREEN before wave completion
- Zero test debt in wave
- All governance gates passed
- Evidence trail complete

### Cumulative (Across Waves)
- All previous wave QA still passes
- No regression from previous waves
- System remains 100% GREEN at all times
- Quality compounds, never erodes

## Lessons Encoded

This canonical sequence embodies lessons from:
- **Backlog cleanup**: Normalization reveals natural dependencies
- **Wave model**: Discrete, stable, cumulative progress
- **Constitutional foundation**: Wave 0 precedes execution waves
- **Dependency respect**: Cannot skip or reorder without understanding impact
