# Zero-Warning/Test-Debt Policy Alignment - Ripple Notification

## Status
**Type**: Ripple Signal  
**Authority**: Governance Administrator  
**Date**: 2026-01-07  
**Effective**: Immediate (upon approval)  
**Scope**: All repositories in Maturion Engineering Ecosystem

---

## Change Summary

The governance canon has been comprehensively updated to make the doctrine of **"Zero warnings and zero test debt – all must be immediately remedied before downstream work proceeds"** explicit, aligned, and non-optional across the entire governance framework.

**Key Principle**: Any agent that discovers warnings or test debt from prior work MUST immediately halt, generate a report, and escalate. The original responsible agent MUST be re-assigned to remediate as BLOCKER before downstream work may proceed.

## Key Changes Summary

### 1. Zero-Warning Doctrine Now Explicit
**Before**: "Zero warnings (unless explicitly whitelisted)" was mentioned but not enforced for prior work  
**After**: "Zero warnings from current work AND prior work" is explicit, with mandatory blocker protocol

---

### 2. Warning Discovery Blocker Protocol Established
**Before**: No clear protocol when agent discovers warnings from prior work  
**After**: Mandatory 6-step protocol:
1. Discovering agent halts immediately
2. Discovering agent generates WARNING_DISCOVERY_REPORT
3. Discovering agent escalates to FM/Governance
4. FM/Governance identifies original agent
5. Original agent remediates as BLOCKER
6. Discovering agent verifies before resuming

---

### 3. FM Pre-Authorization Enhanced
**Before**: FM could authorize work without validating warning status  
**After**: FM MUST execute Section 2.6 (Warning Status Validation) before ANY authorization

---

### 4. Gate Failure Classification Added
**Before**: No gate classification for unresolved warnings  
**After**: Section 5.10 UNRESOLVED_WARNINGS classification with clear remediation protocol

---

### 5. Agent Contracts Strengthened
**Before**: Agent obligations for warning discovery were implicit  
**After**: Explicit obligations in BUILDER_QA_HANDOVER_POLICY.md Section 8.4

---

### 6. Evidence Trail Formalized
**Before**: No standard schemas for warning discovery/remediation  
**After**: Three formal schemas ensure complete audit trail

---

## Impact on Downstream Repositories

### Mandatory Layer-Down Required For:

#### **FM Office App** (`maturion-foreman-office-app`)
**Priority**: IMMEDIATE

**Required Updates**:
1. **.github/agents/ForemanApp-agent.md**
   - Add reference to WARNING_DISCOVERY_BLOCKER_PROTOCOL.md
   - Add Section 2.6 (Warning Status Validation) to FM pre-authorization responsibilities
   - Add warning discovery escalation obligations

2. **.github/agents/*-builder.md** (all builder agent contracts)
   - Add Section 8.4 (Warning Discovery Protocol) obligations
   - Add reference to WARNING_DISCOVERY_REPORT.schema.md
   - Add explicit halt requirement upon warning discovery

3. **governance/qa/** (if exists locally)
   - Create `/governance/qa/warning-whitelist.json` (empty initially)
   - Add warning whitelist management process

4. **governance/evidence/** (if exists locally)
   - Create directory structure:
     - `/governance/evidence/warnings/discovery/`
     - `/governance/evidence/warnings/remediation/`
     - `/governance/evidence/warnings/verification/`
     - `/governance/evidence/warnings/forward-scan/`

5. **.github/workflows/** (CI/CD)
   - RECOMMENDED: Add linter check as blocking gate (fails on any warnings)
   - RECOMMENDED: Add warning count to QA report generation

6. **QA Suite**
   - RECOMMENDED: Add automated warning detection to QA suite
   - RECOMMENDED: Include warning count in BUILD_QA_REPORT.json

---

#### **ISMS Repository** (future)
Same updates as FM Office App (when repository initialized)

---

### Agent Contract Standard Language

All agent contracts in downstream repositories SHOULD include:

```markdown
## Warning and Test-Debt Discovery Obligations

When this agent discovers warnings or test debt from prior work:
1. MUST immediately halt current work
2. MUST generate WARNING_DISCOVERY_REPORT per schema
3. MUST escalate to [FM/Governance] with impact assessment
4. MUST NOT proceed until warnings remediated by responsible agent
5. MUST verify remediation before resuming work

Discovery of warnings from prior work is a BLOCKER requiring original agent re-assignment and remediation before downstream work may proceed.

**Reference**: governance/canon/WARNING_DISCOVERY_BLOCKER_PROTOCOL.md
```

---

## Breaking Changes

### 1. Handover Pre-Conditions Stricter
**Impact**: Builders can no longer hand over work with unresolved prior warnings  
**Mitigation**: Builders must escalate warnings immediately upon discovery

---

### 2. FM Authorization Blocked by Warnings
**Impact**: FM cannot authorize work if prior waves/subwaves have unresolved warnings  
**Mitigation**: FM must execute Section 2.6 validation, remediate before authorization

---

### 3. Gate Failures for Prior Warnings
**Impact**: PRs may fail gate if unresolved prior warnings detected  
**Mitigation**: Follow UNRESOLVED_WARNINGS remediation protocol (Section 5.10)

---

## Non-Breaking Enhancements

### 1. Warning Whitelist Governance
**Enhancement**: Formal process for whitelisting warnings with justification, expiration, review  
**Benefit**: Transparent exception management

---

### 2. Forward-Scan Requirement
**Enhancement**: After warning discovery, ALL pending work must be scanned for same pattern  
**Benefit**: Prevents second-time failures (per BL-019 precedent)

---

### 3. Evidence Trail Completeness
**Enhancement**: Three formal schemas ensure complete audit trail  
**Benefit**: Governance compliance provable, audit-ready

---
