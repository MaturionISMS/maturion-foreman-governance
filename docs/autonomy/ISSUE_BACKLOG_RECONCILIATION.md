# Issue Backlog Reconciliation Report

**Purpose**: Comprehensive analysis and categorization of all existing GitHub issues  
**Status**: Template - Ready for execution  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-12-11

---

## Overview

This report will be generated by the CS10 Issue Backlog Categorizer to analyze all open and closed issues in the repository, categorize them, identify duplicates, link related issues, and provide recommendations for cleanup.

---

## Execution Instructions

### Manual Execution

To generate this report manually, use the following approach:

1. **Fetch all issues from GitHub**
   ```typescript
   import { Octokit } from 'octokit'
   const octokit = new Octokit({ auth: process.env.GITHUB_MCP_TOKEN })
   
   const issues = await octokit.paginate('GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues', {
     owner: 'MaturionISMS',
     repo: 'maturion-foreman-app',
     state: 'all',
     per_page: 100
   })
   ```

2. **Convert to IssueMetadata format**
   ```typescript
   import { IssueMetadata } from '@/lib/foreman/autonomy/issue-backlog-categorizer'
   
   const metadata: IssueMetadata[] = issues.map(issue => ({
     number: issue.number,
     title: issue.title,
     state: issue.state as 'open' | 'closed',
     labels: issue.labels.map(l => typeof l === 'string' ? l : l.name).filter(Boolean),
     created: new Date(issue.created_at),
     updated: new Date(issue.updated_at),
     body: issue.body || ''
   }))
   ```

3. **Generate report**
   ```typescript
   import { getIssueBacklogCategorizer, saveBacklogReport } from '@/lib/foreman/autonomy/issue-backlog-categorizer'
   
   const categorizer = getIssueBacklogCategorizer()
   const report = await categorizer.generateReport(metadata)
   
   saveBacklogReport(report, 'docs/autonomy/ISSUE_BACKLOG_RECONCILIATION.md')
   ```

### Automated Execution

A script will be created to automate this process:

```bash
npm run backlog:reconcile
```

This will:
1. Fetch all issues from GitHub
2. Run CS10 categorization
3. Generate comprehensive report
4. Save to `docs/autonomy/ISSUE_BACKLOG_RECONCILIATION.md`

---

## Report Structure

The generated report will include:

### 1. Summary Statistics
- Total issues analyzed
- Open vs closed breakdown
- Issues by category
- Duplicate count
- Related issue groups

### 2. Categorization Results

Issues will be categorized into:
- **Build Philosophy Extensions**: Build process improvements
- **Architecture Work**: System design and architecture
- **Governance Work**: Policy and compliance
- **Bug Fixes**: Defects and errors
- **Builder Training**: Builder network improvements
- **Performance Issues**: Performance and optimization
- **Deprecations**: Removal of obsolete code
- **Constitutional Systems**: CS1-CS10 implementations
- **Autonomy Implementation**: Autonomy features
- **QA Enhancement**: Quality assurance improvements
- **Documentation**: Documentation updates
- **Uncategorized**: Issues needing manual review

### 3. Duplicate Detection

Lists all duplicate issues with:
- Issue number
- Duplicate of issue number
- Similarity score
- Recommendation (close duplicate)

### 4. Related Issue Groups

Groups of related issues that should be:
- Considered together
- Potentially merged
- Cross-referenced

### 5. Recommendations

Specific actions recommended:
- **To Close**: Duplicates, stale issues
- **To Merge**: Related issues that should be combined
- **To Split**: Large issues that should be broken down

---

## Expected Outcomes

Based on the Build Readiness Survey, the system has:
- ✅ All constitutional systems CS1-CS10 implemented
- ✅ Full autonomy infrastructure operational
- ✅ 96% readiness for autonomous building

Expected issue categories distribution:
- **Constitutional Systems**: 10-15 issues (CS1-CS10 implementations) - COMPLETED
- **Autonomy Implementation**: 5-10 issues (autonomy features) - IN PROGRESS
- **Builder Network**: 10-20 issues (builder improvements) - NEEDS PHASE 3
- **Build Philosophy**: 5-10 issues (QA-first improvements)
- **Architecture**: 10-15 issues (system design)
- **Governance**: 5-10 issues (policy and compliance)
- **QA Enhancement**: 5-10 issues (quality improvements)
- **Bug Fixes**: 5-10 issues (defects)
- **Documentation**: 3-5 issues (docs)

**Total Expected**: 60-100 issues

## Next Steps After Report Generation

1. **Review Categorization**
   - Validate AI categorization
   - Manually adjust any miscategorized issues

2. **Process Duplicates**
   - Close duplicate issues
   - Update references to point to canonical issue

3. **Link Related Issues**
   - Add cross-references
   - Create issue hierarchies if needed

4. **Clean Backlog**
   - Close stale issues
   - Archive completed work
   - Update issue priorities

5. **Plan Execution**
   - Sequence issues by priority
   - Assign to execution waves
   - Begin autonomous building

## Integration with Other Systems

This report integrates with:
- **CS7 Autonomy Pilot Log**: Logs categorization actions
- **CS8 Supervision Graph**: Validates categorization decisions
- **CS9 Full Context**: Uses issue data in context
- **CS10 Issue Categorizer**: Primary categorization engine

---
