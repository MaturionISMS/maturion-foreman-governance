# Wave Execution Summaries

This directory contains execution summaries for each autonomous wave.

Wave summaries are automatically generated when waves complete and provide:
- Wave configuration and status
- Issues executed with results
- Wave metrics (success rate, duration, builder distribution)
- Governance events
- Lessons learned

## Format

Each wave summary follows this naming convention:
`WAVE_[N]_SUMMARY.md`

Where `[N]` is the wave number (1, 2, 3, etc.)

## Example

- `WAVE_1_SUMMARY.md` - First wave execution
- `WAVE_2_SUMMARY.md` - Second wave execution

Summaries are created automatically by the Wave Orchestrator when a wave completes.
