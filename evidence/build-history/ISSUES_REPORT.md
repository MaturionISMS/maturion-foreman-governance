Many issues (#253-#240, #137-#119) focus on creating self-regulating, self-improving autonomous systems with built-in safety constraints.

### Quality Assurance Evolution  
Significant emphasis on evolving QA systems (QIEL, QIW, QIC) to prevent failures and ensure 100% quality standards.

### Memory & Learning Systems
Multiple issues (#150, #149, #141, #120) focus on persistent memory, learning, and knowledge consolidation across multi-agent systems.

### Meta-Cognition & Safety
Issues #137-#129 create advanced meta-cognitive capabilities with strong safety and ethical constraints.
