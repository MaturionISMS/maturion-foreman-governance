# JOHAN EXECUTION MAP
Version: 0.2 (Living Document)  
Purpose: Human-oriented execution map for the Maturion Autonomous Engineering Program

This document exists to keep Johan oriented at all times.  
If something exists but is not reflected here, it is not “real” yet.

---

## 0. ORIENTATION (Always Read First)

- This is the **single source of truth** for execution state.
- Detours are allowed, but **must be recorded here**.
- Waves may expand internally, but **wave order is preserved**.
- My only mandatory intervention points:
  - Start (authorization)
  - End (UI validation)
  - Governance override requests

## 1. FOUNDATION (Waves 0–2)

<details>
<summary><strong>1.1 Core Philosophy & Governance</strong></summary>

- [x] Build Philosophy defined
- [x] OPOJD implemented
- [x] CS1–CS6 active
- [x] Governance Supremacy Rule enforced
- [x] FL/CI system added

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>1.2 Execution Substrate</strong></summary>

- [x] Autonomy Runtime (AUTO-01)
- [x] Wave Execution Engine (AUTO-02)
- [x] Recovery Engine (AUTO-03)
- [x] Multi-Repo Management (AUTO-04)
- [x] Global Autonomy Orchestrator (AUTO-05)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>1.3 Swarm & Coordination</strong></summary>

- [x] Wave 2 — Multi-Agent Swarm Coordination Engine
- [x] Autonomous Refactoring Agent
- [x] Swarm Telemetry & CLI Dashboard

</details>

## 2. MEMORY SUITE (Waves 1–3)

<details>
<summary><strong>2.1 Memory Storage & Semantics</strong></summary>

- [x] STM (Short-Term Memory)
- [x] LTM (Tenant-Isolated Long-Term Memory)
- [x] Governance Memory (Immutable, audited)
- [x] Embodiment Sync

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2.2 Memory Lifecycle</strong></summary>

- [x] Wave 1B — Knowledge Retirement
- [x] Drift Impact Analysis
- [x] Consolidation hooks
- [x] Preview / non-destructive modes

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2.3 Memory Awareness</strong></summary>

- [x] Wave 3A — Constraint Model & Architecture Signatures
- [x] Wave 3B — Constraint Violation Detection
- [x] Wave 3C — Constraint Enforcement Hooks

**Memory Suite Complete:**
✔ Storage  
✔ Lifecycle  
✔ Governance  
✔ Awareness  
✔ Enforcement  

</details>

---

## 3. ARCHITECTURE SELF-AWARENESS (COMPLETE)

<details>
<summary><strong>3.1 Constraint System</strong></summary>

- [x] Constraint taxonomy (structural / contract / governance)
- [x] Deterministic architecture signatures
- [x] Drift detection & classification
- [x] Enforcement policies (Allow / Warn / Block / Escalate)

</details>

📌 Result:  
The system can observe, classify, explain, and enforce architectural correctness with full governance awareness (CS1–CS6).  
No silent blocking.  
100% GREEN.
