## Quality Integrity Incidents (Auto-Generated - TO BE CLOSED)

The following issues are CI-generated Quality Integrity Incidents that should be closed:

**Total Count**: ~92 issues (UPDATED from ~50-60)

### Identified QII Issues:
- #180, #182, #183, #184, #186, #191, #192, #195, #197, #198, #199, #200
- #202, #203, #206, #207, #218-#224, #227, #230-#231, #234, #237, #239
- Plus approximately 70+ additional QII issues

These issues share common characteristics:
- Title pattern: "🚨 Quality Integrity Incident"
- Created by: `github-actions` bot
- Labels: `quality-integrity`, `qiel`, `automated`
- Body contains: workflow run links, QIEL enforcement messages

**Action Required**: Systematic closure with documentation explaining transition to improved QIEL workflows.

**Note**: Updated count based on ISSUES_REPORT.md dated 2025-12-08.

**QII Count Update Explanation**: The increase from ~50-60 (original estimate in 2025-12-12 report) to ~92 (verified count) represents a more accurate recount of EXISTING QII issues, not new issues. The original estimate was based on manual sampling, while the ISSUES_REPORT.md used comprehensive automated pattern matching to identify all QII issues created by the github-actions bot. All 92 QII issues existed before the original backlog cleanup report date.
