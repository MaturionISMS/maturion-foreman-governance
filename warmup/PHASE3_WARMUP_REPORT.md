## 3. Identified Defects and Recommendations

### Defect #WU-001: Checkpointing Not Fully Implemented

**Component**: Builder Runtime  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Impact**: Builders cannot resume from crash state  
**Root Cause**: Checkpointing architecture defined in v1.1 but implementation incomplete  
**Evidence**: Builder Network Check, Section 2.1, Readiness Point 5

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Probability**: Low (builder crashes are rare)
- **Impact**: Medium (manual recovery required if crash occurs)
- **Overall Risk**: Low-Medium

**Mitigation**:
- Manual recovery procedures available
- Builder health monitoring active (detects crashes immediately)
- Escalation pathway operational (Owner notified on crash)

**Recommendation**: **DEFER** to Issue #57 (Memory Fabric) or Phase 3 stabilization. Proceed with Wave 1 using manual recovery if needed.

---

### Defect #WU-002: Fallback Chain Not Validated

**Component**: Builder Routing  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Impact**: Cannot verify automatic failover to secondary builder  
**Root Cause**: Fallback logic exists but never executed in test scenario  
**Evidence**: Builder Network Check, Section 2.1, Readiness Point 9

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Probability**: Low (primary builder has 100% success rate)
- **Impact**: Medium (automatic failover not guaranteed)
- **Overall Risk**: Low-Medium

**Mitigation**:
- Primary builder (GitHub Copilot) is healthy and operational (100% success rate)
- Fallback logic exists in builder router
- Manual fallback to secondary builder possible

**Recommendation**: **MONITOR** during Wave 1 execution. If primary builder fails, validate fallback manually and document results. Execute dedicated fallback test in Phase 3 stabilization.
