# Governance Convergence Decision

## Status
ACTIVE

## Decision

Governance convergence mode is active.

Effective immediately:
- No pull request may be merged while failing governance gates
- No admin or manual bypasses are permitted
- All RED states must be either fixed or explicitly declared as Expected REDs
- Governance changes must proceed through convergence rules

The earlier merge of agent.md and agent-contract.md while gates were failing
was a one-time corrective action taken before convergence was declared.

That exception is now CLOSED.

## Rationale

This decision restores enforcement discipline after governance scaffolding
was introduced without formal agent contracts.
