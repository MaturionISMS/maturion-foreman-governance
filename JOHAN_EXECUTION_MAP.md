# JOHAN EXECUTION MAP
Version: 0.1 (Living Document)
Purpose: Human-oriented execution map for the Maturion Autonomous Engineering Program

This document exists to keep Johan oriented at all times.
If something exists but is not reflected here, it is not “real” yet.

---

## 0. ORIENTATION (Always Read First)

- This is the *single source of truth* for execution state.
- Detours are allowed, but must be recorded here.
- Waves may expand internally, but wave order is preserved.
- My only mandatory intervention points:
  - Start (authorization)
  - End (UI validation)
  - Governance override requests
